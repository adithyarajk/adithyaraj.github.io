                    <p>The Speech Processing Lab headed by Prof. S. Umesh in the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras
                        <br> is seeking applications for the post of Project Associate. They will be working on Natural Language 
                        <br>Translation Mission (NLTM) of the Govt. of India. The objective is to develop Indian Language technology
                        <br> systems and products and deploy them in the field with the help of start-ups. Prof. Umesh is leading the
                        <br> Automatic Speech Recognition part ofthe project. The candidateâ€™s day to day role would involve building
                        <br> state of the art ASR Systems in Indian languages using deep learning ideas including sequence-to-sequence 
                        <br>modelling based on CTC, transformers,wav2vec, BERT and GPT as well as conventional DNN, CNN and TDNN.
